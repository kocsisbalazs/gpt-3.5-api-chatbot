### Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to create a simple chatbot. The chatbot interacts with users, responds to their messages, and holds conversations just like in the original site.

### OpenAI API

**[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/)** is a company that provides powerful natural language processing models, including GPT-3.5-turbo. The **OpenAI API** allows developers to integrate these models into their applications, enabling them to understand and generate human-like text.

### Code Explanation

1. The code in this project is a Python script that uses the OpenAI API to interact with the GPT-3.5-turbo model. 
2. The code initializes the OpenAI API key, defines a function `chatGPT`, and sets up a conversation loop with the chatbot.
3. The `chatGPT` function sends a user's message. To structure messages as a conversation, In this case, we have a list of messages, each with a "role" ("user" or "assistant") and "content" (the text of the message). This allows the model to understand the context and provide context-aware responses.

### Usage

1. Obtain an OpenAI API key: You'll need to sign up for OpenAI and get your API key. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` in the code with your actual key.
2. Install required packages: You might need to install the `openai` package. You can do this using `pip install openai`.
3. Run the script: Execute the Python script. The chatbot will engage in conversations with users.
